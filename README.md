# BusTime Client
This is a simple Python client for the BusTime API used by the Pittsburgh Port Authority. 

[Details](http://realtime.portauthority.org/bustime/home.jsp).

It should be usable for *any* BusTime-based transit API. Also depends on Google's 
DistanceMatrix API for doing distance calculations.
